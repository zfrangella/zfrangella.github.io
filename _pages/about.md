About Me
======
I am a research scientist at Granica working on large-scale machine learning and compression. Prior to joining Granica, I completed my PhD in machine learning and optimization at Stanford University. I earned an M.S. in Applied Mathematics from the Center for Applied Mathematics at Cornell University and a B.S. in Mathematics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

Research Interests
======
My primary interests are in large-scale machine learning and building scalable learning systems that can be deployed in real-world pipelines. Previously, my PhD work focused on designing efficient optimization algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees for large-scale machine learning and data analysis, with diverse applications ranging from generalized linear models to physics-informed neural networks.
