About Me
======
I am currently seeking full-time opportunities in industry. I recently finished my PhD in machine learning and optimization at Stanford University advised by Madeleine Udell. Before Stanford, I was at the Center for Applied Mathematics at Cornell University, where I earned an M.S. degree in Applied Mathematics. I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

Research Interests
======
My primary interests are machine learning, optimization, and numerical linear algebra. My PhD work focused on designing efficient optimization algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees for large-scale machine learning and data analysis. Topics I have worked on include linear system solving, composite optimization, and empirical risk minimization. A recurring theme in my work is leveraging randomized numerical linear algebra to dramatically accelerate computation, while maintaining rigorous convergence guarantees. Applications of my work include generalized linear models, kernel learning, and physics-informed neural networks.
